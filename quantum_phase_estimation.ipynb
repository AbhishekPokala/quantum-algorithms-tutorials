    "\n",
    "The quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm is a quantum algorithm for estimating the phase of an eigenvector of a unitary operator [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_phase_estimation_algorithm)]. One of the main applications of the algorithm is to estimate eigenvalues (energies) of some molecule's $H$ Hamiltonian [[2](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/309/5741/1704)]. Also, phase estimation is frequently used as a subroutine in other quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm and the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_phase_estimation_algorithm)]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the algorithm is to estimate the eigenvalue of a given Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$. We exponentiate it and obtain $U = e^{i\\hat{H}t}$ unitary operator, where $t$ is some parameter (in our example $t = 1$). Then we apply quantum circuit that corresponds to $U = e^{i\\hat{H}t}$ on one of the eigenvectors of the $\\hat{H}$. For simplicity, we will take such $\\hat{H}$, which eigenvectors will be the states $\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle$ and $\\left| 1 \\right\\rangle$ (for this $\\hat{H}$ should be a diagonal matrix). In our example, we will try to find eigenvalue that corresponds to $\\left| 1 \\right\\rangle$ eigenvector. More mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\hat{H} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "E_1 & 0\\\\\n",
    "0 & E_2\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix} \\longrightarrow\n",
    "e^{i\\hat{H}t} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "e^{i E_1 t} & 0\\\\\n",
    "0 & e^{i E_2 t} \n",
    "\\end{pmatrix} \\longrightarrow e^{i H t} \\left| 1 \\right\\rangle = e^{i E_2 t} \\left| 1 \\right\\rangle = e^{i 2 \\pi \\varphi_2} \\left| 1 \\right\\rangle,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the eigenvalues of the $\\hat{H}$, $\\varphi_2 = \\frac{E_2 t}{2 \\pi}$ is the phase that the algorithm is capable to estimate. Note that $U = e^{i H t}$ is a unitary operator and in the code, we will name it as ```unitary```.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Final notes**: Here we didn't implement classical textbook version of QPE algorithm. In the textbook [[4](https://www.cambridge.org/am/academic/subjects/physics/quantum-physics-quantum-information-and-quantum-computation/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information-10th-anniversary-edition?format=HB)] the algorithm is done via inverse QFT with SWAP gates. If we want to implement the algorithm with inverse QFT, we should change a little. Firstly, the order of control ```unitary``` gates should be changed: $i$th ancillary should control $U^{2^{(n - i - 1)}}$ gate on $q$ register. Secondly, SWAP gates are added after controlled unitaries of the algorithm in order to obtain inverse QFT. Here is the textbook [[4](https://www.cambridge.org/am/academic/subjects/physics/quantum-physics-quantum-information-and-quantum-computation/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information-10th-anniversary-edition?format=HB)] implementation of the algorithm:\n",

Not only they increase the gate number of the circuit, but also they add errors. So, that is why we are avoiding SWAP gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are some details about Trotterization, the $t$ parameter in the $U = e^{iHt}$, what should we do when the eigenvalue is negative that we don't cover here. If you interested in these topics you can check our [IQPE](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/iterative_quantum_phase_estimation.ipynb) tutorial, that is a modification of QPE algorithm. There are two main differences between QPE and IQPE algorithms. QPE demands $n$ ancillary qubits for $n$ bit phase estimation, IQPE demands only one ancillary qubit for any $n$ bit phase estimation. The second difference is that QPE applies inverse QFT, and IQPE applies inverse QFT iteratively ($R_z$ rotations are applied iteratively)."
