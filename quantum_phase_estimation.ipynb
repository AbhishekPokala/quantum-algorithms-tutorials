    "The quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm is a quantum algorithm for estimating the phase of an eigenvector of a unitary operator [1]. One of the main applications of the algorithm is to estimate eigenvalues (energies) of some molecule's $H$ Hamiltonian [2]. Phase estimation is frequently used as a subroutine in other quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm and the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations [1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the algorithm is to estimate the eigenvalue of a given Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$. We exponantiate it and obtain $U = e^{i\\hat{H}t}$ unitary operator, where $t$ is some parameter (in our example $t = 1$). Then we apply quantum circuit that corresponds to $U = e^{i\\hat{H}t}$ on some eigenvector of the $\\hat{H}$. For simplicity we will take such $\\hat{H}$, which eigenvectors will be the states $\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle$ and $\\left| 1 \\right\\rangle$ (for this $\\hat{H}$ should be a diaganal matrix). In our example we will try to find eigenvalue that corresponds to $\\left| 1 \\right\\rangle$ eigenvector. More mathematically:\n",

    "\n",
    "where $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the eigenvalues of the $\\hat{H}$, $\\varphi_2 = \\frac{E_2 t}{2 \\pi}$ is the phase that the algorithm is capable to estimate. Note that $U = e^{i H t}$ is a unitary operator and in code we will name it as ```unitary```.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code and the algorithm is similar to the [IPEA](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/iterative_phase_estimation.ipynb) algorithm, which tutorial we also have covered.

    "**Final notes**: Here we didn't implemented classical textbook version of QPE algorithm. In textbooks [4] the algorithm is done via inverse QFT with SWAP gates. If we want to implement the algorithm with inverse QFT, we should change a little. Firstly the order of control ```unitary``` gates should be changed: $0$th ancllary should controll $U^n$ gate on $q$, instead of $U$ gate, register and the last $n$th qubit should control $U$ gate, instead of $U^n$. Secondly SWAP gates are added after control unitary part of the algorithm in order to obtain invers QFT. Here is the textbook [4] implementation of the algorithm:\n",

    "How you have seen we did the job of the algorithm without SWAP gates and obtained the result. The SWAP gates doesn't add anything to this algorithm and we can omit them. Moreover SWAP gates are two qubit gates that in real quantum computer in general have big error rate. Not only they increase the gate number of the circuit, but also they add errors. So, this is the motivation that we avoided to use the SWAP gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also they are some details about Trotterization, the $t$ parameter in the $U = e^{iHt}$, what should we do when the eigenvalue is negative that we don't cover here. If you interested in this topics you can check out our [IPEA](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/iterative_phase_estimation.ipynb) tutorial, that is a modification of QPE algorithm. There are two main differences between QPE and IPEA algorithms. QPE demands $n$ ancillary qubits for $n$ bit phase estimation, IPEA demands only one ancillary qubit for any $n$ bit phase estimation. The second difference is that QPE applies inverse QFT, and IPEA applies inverse QFT iteratively ($R_z$ rotations are applied iteratively)."
