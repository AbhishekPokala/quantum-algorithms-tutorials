# Tutorials for Quantum Algorithms
The goal of this repository to share knowledge about quantum algorithms via jupyter notebook tutorials. Here are the tutorials that exist in this repository (only one yet) and planed tutorials (italic). 

* [Iterative phase estimation algorithm (IPEA)](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/iterative_phase_estimation.ipynb)

* *Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)*

* *Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA)*

P.S. If you will find errors in the codes or in the text (grammer, math) please let me know.
