# Tutorials for Quantum Algorithms
The goal of this repository to share knowledge about quantum algorithms via jupyter notebook tutorials. Here are the tutorials that exist in this repository (only one yet) and planed tutorial (marked red).


1) [Iterative phase estimation algorithm](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/iterative_phase_estimation.ipynb)

2) [variational quantum eigensolver] <span style="color:red"> *some emphasized markdown text*</span>

3) [Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)]
