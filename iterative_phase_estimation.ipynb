    "# Iterative phase estimation algorithm \n",
    "\n",
    "The iterative phase estimation algorithm is a quantum algorithm to estimate the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenvector of a unitary operator [1]. One of the main applications of the algorithm is to estimate eigenvalues (energies of corresponding eigenstates) for some molecule's $H$ Hamiltonian. Because $H$ is a Hermitian operator, not unitary, (the algorithm works only with unitary operators) we can't estimate directly its eigenvalues. Instead, we create some unitary operator from $H$ and estimate not the eigenvalues of $H$, but something different (the **phase**). The good news is that from this **phase** (we will talk about it later) one can obtain the corresponding eigenvalue of $H$. So, in the end, we are not only estimating the **phase** but, what is more important, the desired eigenvalue. Here are the main steps of the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create unitary operator $U$ from given $H$: \n",
    "$$U = e^{iHt}.$$ \n",
    "Here $t$ is a parameter that we can change\n",
    "   \n",
    "2) Apply $U$ on the eigenstate $| \\psi_k \\rangle$ of $H$. For simplicity, we will assume that the eigenstate is given: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$U | \\psi_k \\rangle = e^{iHt} | \\psi_k \\rangle$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "From the Taylor series for the exponent we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{iHt} | \\psi_k \\rangle = i t H | \\psi_k \\rangle - \\frac{t^2}{2} H^2 | \\psi_k \\rangle + \\frac{t^4}{4} H^4 | \\psi_k \\rangle - ...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And by using the Schr√∂dinger equation $H | \\psi_k \\rangle = E_{k} | \\psi_k \\rangle$, we will obtain: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{iHt} |\\psi_k \\rangle = e^{iE_{k}t} |\\psi_k \\rangle,$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_k$ is the eigenvalue of the corresponding $| \\psi_k \\rangle$ eigenstate. By the way, the goal of the algorithm is to find $E_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) It easy to see that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{iHt}|\\psi_k \\rangle = e^{iE_{k}t} |\\psi_k \\rangle  = e^{i 2 \\pi \\varphi} |\\psi_k \\rangle ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\varphi = E_{k}t / 2 \\pi$ is the **phase** that the algorithm is capable to estimate. After estimating the phase it will be easy to estimate the corresponding eigenvalue:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E_{k} = 2 \\pi \\varphi / t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see how the algorithm actually works. Firstly, we should import all the packages that we will use."

If the phase is $0$ the state of the ancillary qubit will be equal to $|+\\rangle_a$ state and if it is $\\frac{1}{2}$ the state will be equal to  $|- \\rangle_a$. After this we apply to the ancillary qubit the Hadamard gate. In this step, the $|+\\rangle_a$ state will transform to the $|0\\rangle_a$ state and the $|-\\rangle_a$ state will transform to the $|0\\rangle_a$ state. So, just by measuring the ancillary qubit one will know is the phase $0$ or $\\frac{1}{2}$.

Moreover, we should start estimating the bits starting from the last bit. For example let's find $\\varphi = 0.11$ **phase**. Notice, that after **cantrol_H** we will have following exponent $exp(i 2 \\pi 0.11)$. If we will apply **cantrol_H** twice we will obtain two exponents $exp(i 2 \\pi 0.11) \\cdot exp(i 2 \\pi 0.11) = exp(i 2 \\pi 0.1)$, because $2 \\cdot 0.11 = 2 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4}) = (1 + \\frac{1}{2}) = 1.1$. This way we are coming to the simple example explained above (\\varphi is equal to $0$ or $\\frac{1}{2}$). So it will be easy to estimate the second bit from $\\varphi = 0.11$. At the second iteration, we are going to estimate the first bit of the $\\varphi$. For that we will apply only one **cantrol_H** ($exp(i 2 \\pi 0.11)$). Now we remamber value of the second bit $\\varphi_1$. It will be nice if we will subtract from the **phase** the $\\varphi_1$. We will do it with the phase gate. In qiskit this action corresponds to this gate **u1(-phase_shift, a[0])**, where **phase_shift** contains all estimated bits that we should subtract to come to the simple phase case ($0$ or $\\frac{1}{2}$ case).\n",
