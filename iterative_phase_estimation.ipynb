    "\tIterative phase estimation algorithm\n",
    "</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterative phase estimation algorithm is a quantum algorithm for estimating the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenvector of a unitary operator [1]. One of the main applications of the algorithm is to estimate eigenvalues (energies) of some molecule's $H$ Hamiltonian. Because $H$ is a Hermitian operator, not unitary, (the algorithm works only with unitary operators) we can't estimate directly its eigenvalues. Instead, we create some unitary operator from $H$ and estimate not the eigenvalues of $H$, but something different (the phase). From the estimated phase one can obtain the corresponding eigenvalue of $H$. So, in the end, we are not only estimating the phase but, what is more important, the desired eigenvalue. Here are the main steps of the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create unitary operator $U$ from given $H$: \n",
    "$$U = e^{iHt}.$$ \n",
    "Here $t$ is a parameter.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2) Apply $U$ on the eigenstate $\\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle$ of $H$. For simplicity, we will assume that the eigenstate is given: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$U \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle = e^{iHt} \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "From the Taylor series for the exponent we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{iHt} \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle = i t H \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle - \\frac{t^2}{2} H^2 \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle + \\frac{t^4}{4} H^4 \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle - ...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And by using the Schr√∂dinger equation $H \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle = E_{k} \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle$, we will obtain: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{iHt} \\left|\\psi_k \\right\\rangle = e^{iE_{k}t} \\left|\\psi_k \\right\\rangle,$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_k$ is the eigenvalue of the corresponding $\\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle$ eigenstate. The goal of the algorithm is to find $E_k$s.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) It easy to see that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{iHt}\\left|\\psi_k \\right\\rangle = e^{iE_{k}t} \\left|\\psi_k \\right\\rangle  = e^{i 2 \\pi \\varphi_k} \\left|\\psi_k \\right\\rangle,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\varphi_k = E_{k}t / 2 \\pi$ is the phase that the algorithm is capable to estimate. After estimating the phase it will be easy to estimate the corresponding eigenvalue:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E_{k} = 2 \\pi \\varphi_k / t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see how the algorithm actually works. Firstly, we should import all the packages that we will use."

The estimation is starting from the last bit. For example let's find $\\varphi = 0.11$ phase. Notice, that after ```cantrol_H``` we will have the following exponent $exp(i 2 \\pi 0.11)$. After applying ```cantrol_H``` twice one will obtain two exponents $exp(i 2 \\pi 0.11) \\cdot exp(i 2 \\pi 0.11) = exp(i 2 \\pi 0.1)$, because $2 \\cdot 0.11 = 2 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4}) = (1 + \\frac{1}{2}) = 1.1$. This way we come to the simple example explained above ($\\varphi$ is equal to $0$ or $\\frac{1}{2}$). So it will be easy to estimate the second bit from $\\varphi = 0.11$. At the second iteration the ```cantrol_H``` is applied once ($exp(i 2 \\pi 0.11)$). Then the estimated second bit $\\varphi_1$ is subtracted from the phase with a phase gate. In qiskit this action corresponds to the gate ```u1(-phase_shift, a[0])```, where ```phase_shift``` contains all the estimated bits. This way at each iteration we will come to the simple phase case ($0$ or $\\frac{1}{2}$ case).\n",
